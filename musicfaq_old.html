<h4><strong>Q.</strong> What ths difference between MP3 and AAC files?</h4> 
<p><strong>A.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding" target="_blank">AAC</a>
is a newer format that boasts higher musical fidelity than MP3s at the
same bittrate&#8212;in other words, AAC files simply sound better. AAC files
are compatible with nearly all recent digital music players and
operating systems, including all iPods and iPhones, as well as players
from Creative, Microsoft and Sony, among others. MP3s are sonically
inferior, though are compatible with a broader range of music players.
It would be wise to make sure your player can play AAC files before
choosing them over MP3&#8212;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#Hardware" target="_blank">here is an incomplete list of some hardware that supports AAC</a>.
Also worth noting&#8212;you can easily re-encode AAC files to MP3s, if you
need MP3 versions at a later date, using free music managment software
such as Apple's iTunes.</p>
